RASPBERRY PI POWER SUPPLY WITH I2C CONTROL
==========================================

A simple switching mode power supply with easily available parts. Either fixed
5.0 voltage output regulator 2576T-5 or adjustable voltage model 2576T-ADJ
can be used. With the latter it is possible to get output of 5.1 V or 5.2 V
to compensate resistive losses in the connecting USB cable. A PIC processor
is used to switch the power on/off and to monitor the battery voltage.

The circuit is being tested at the time of writing this README file. Building 
needs good understaning of the circuit and good skills in electronics. Badly
build power supply could damage the Raspberry Pi permanently.
